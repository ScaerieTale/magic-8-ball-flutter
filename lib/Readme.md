# Magic-8-Ball

## written in Flutter V3.8.8

Thanks to the London App Brewery https://appbrewery.com/ for the Magic 8 ball assets. This entire code base is written by me under the Creative Commons license. As such the build files contain no custom app icons. This project was for educational purposes only :)

The web app version is available here: https://scaerietale.github.io/magic--ball-flutter - but it looks way more impressive running on a phone, honestly! ðŸ’œ
