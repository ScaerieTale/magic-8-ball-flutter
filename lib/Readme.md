# Magic-8-Ball

## written in Flutter V3.8.8

Thanks to the London App Brewery https://appbrewery.com/ for the Magic 8 ball assets. This entire code base is written by me under the Creative Commons license. As such the build files contain no custom app icons. This project was for educational purposes only :)

Everything works flawlessly under debug mode, but for some reason I can't get the web app to actually load once built. As soon as I do, I'll update this repo with a web directory for github pages. üëç
